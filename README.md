# Digital Control System for Ninja Motor

## Objective:
Designed and implemented a control system to regulate the operation time of a blender's DC motor.
## Techniques Used:
Used: Utilized digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND) and units (flip-flops, timers) to process control signals.
## Simulation: 
Conducted simulations and circuit design using NI Multisim.
## Control Mechanism:
Implemented a timing mechanism to start and stop the motor based on predefined intervals.
## Skills Developed:
Digital logic design, timing control, problem-solving, and hands-on experience with electronic components.
